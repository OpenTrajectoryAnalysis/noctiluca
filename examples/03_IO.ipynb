The latter gives the number of lines at the start of the file to ignore; in this case we set it to 1, such that we start reading right at the data.\n",
    "+ But wait, that means we ignore the column names completely? Yes! ``load.csv()`` does not care what your columns are called (or whether they have names at all, for that matter). How to process the data is instead specified by the ``columns`` argument. This list assigns pre-defined identifiers to the columns, in the order in which they appear in the file.\n",
    "+ two of those identifiers are mandatory: ``'id'`` should be a column that has a unique entry for each trajectory, identifying which localization belongs to which trajectory; ``'t'`` should be a column containing integer frame numbers. Note that missing frames (above: frame 9 in trajectory 5) are simply patched with ``np.nan``.\n",
    "+ beyond those two, possible identifiers are ``x, y, z, x2, y2, z2`` for spatial coordinates of trajectories with up to three spatial dimensions and two particles; and ``None``, which indicates that the corresponding column should be ignored\n",
    "+ finally, any string not recognized as one of the defined identifiers means that the data from the corresponding column will be written to the ``meta``-dict of the corresponding trajectory, with that string as key. Refer to [nl.io.load.csv()](../noctiluca.io.rst#noctiluca.io.load.csv) for more details."
